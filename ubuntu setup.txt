Starting with the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, Microsoft is making some Linux distros, including Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

 12, and OpenSUSE Leap 42 available in the Windows Store. Additionally, it's no longer a prerequisite to enable Developer mode, which makes the installation of Linux distros a lot easier.

However, a number of users a seeing an error code 0x8007007e as they try to install any of the distros, but it's not a bug in the software. Instead, users are seeing this error because the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), the compatibility layer to run Linux binary executables on Windows 10 is missing.

In this Windows 10 guide, we'll walk you through the steps to successfully install Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12, and openSUSE Leap 42 on your device.

How to install Windows Subsystem for Linux
Before you can install any version of Linux on Windows 10, you must install WSL using Control Panel.

Open Settings.
Click on Apps.
Click on Apps & features.
Under "Related settings," on the right side, click the Programs and Features link.


Click the Turn Windows features on or off link.


On "Windows Features," check the Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta) option.

in Ubuntu terminal: jupyter notebook --no-browser
location is below:
C:\Users\Anyone\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\newuser

Click OK.
Click Restart now.
After completing the steps, you can open the Windows Store to get the Linux distro you want to use.

START HERE

Installing Windows Subsystem for Linux using PowerShell
If you prefer using the command line method, it's also possible to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux using PowerShell.

Open Start.
Search for PowerShell, right-click the result, and click Run as administrator.
Type the following command to add the required module and press Enter:
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

Type Y to complete the installation and restart your computer.


How to install Linux distros on Windows 10
After adding the Windows System for Linux module to your computer, there are two ways to install Ubuntu or SUSE Linux distros on Windows 10: you can use Command Prompt or the Windows Store.

Installing Linux distros using Command Prompt
Open Start.
Search for Command Prompt, right-click the result, and click Run as administrator.
Type one of the following commands to install Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12, or openSUSE Leap 42 and press Enter:

ubuntu
sles-12
opensuse-42
As you execute the command, the required files will download and install automatically on your device. Then simply follow the on-screen directions to complete the setup.

Installing Linux distros using Windows Store
Perhaps an easier way to install Linux distros on Windows 10 is to use the Windows Store using the following links:

Ubuntu
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12
openSUSE Leap 42
Once the installation completes, launch the app, and complete the on-screen directions.

Remember that you're not limited to install just one version of Linux. If you want, you can also install all three, including Fedora Linux when it becomes available in the Store, and run them all simultaneously.

You can install Linux distros using the Store starting with the release of the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. However, if you have a device enrolled in the Windows Insider Program running the latest test build for PC, you can try any of them immediately. Also, note that devices running the Windows 10 Creators Update only supports Ubuntu, which can be installed using these steps.

FROM SACRIFICE TO SAGA

Senua's Saga: Hellblade II
Source: Xbox Game Studios
At the Game Awards 2019, Phil Spencer surprised the world by announcing the next Xbox console and a new Ninja Theory game, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II. This is our first look at a true next-generation title. Technically, Halo Infinite gave us footage of a game running on next-generation Xbox hardware (or on a PC with ballpark specs) but Senua's Sacrifice: Hellblade II is the first Xbox Game Studios title explicitly being designed from the ground-up for the Xbox Series X.

Senua's Saga: Hellblade II story
In the first game, Senua went on a journey into Hel and confronted all sorts of mythical beasts and deities, including the fire giant Surt and the God of Illusion, Valravn. She also made peace with the "darkness" inside her, the voices Ninja Theory has explictly confirmed were designed around modern-day descriptions of psychosis. While we don't know much about the story of the sequel so far, it appears to be taking an even darker tone, delving into ideas of Pict and Nord rituals and sacrifice.

Whatever the story ends up dealing with, Ninja Theory is consulting mental health professionals as part of The Insight Project, developing games around understanding mental illness. You can check out the reveal trailer from the Game Awards below.


Senua's Saga: Hellblade II gameplay and features
Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice was a third-person game with combat and puzzles. We have every reason to expect that the sequel will be very similar however, it likely has a far larger budget, which could mean more complicated combat, bigger setpieces and a larger game. Here's what we know right now.

This is a different team at Ninja Theory than the one under Rahni Tucker developing Bleeding Edge.
Melina Juergens is reprising her role as Senua, providing some truly incredible performance capture.
Footage for the trailer was captured in-engine.
The game is likely running on Unreal Engine 4.
Ninja Theory is working with the band Heilung for the soundtrack.
Heilung's music can be heard in the reveal trailer for the game, the song is called In Maidjan.

Will Senua's Saga: Hellblade II be on Xbox One?
When Phil Spencer presented the Xbox Series X at the Game Awards 2019, right before the trailer Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, he noted that the game being shown was early in development for the Xbox Series X, although we're unsure if that means it won't be coming to the original console. We've reached out to Microsoft for a comment.

The official press release and all the marketing materials only mention the Xbox Series X. It will certainly come to PC though, as all Xbox Game Studios titles arrive on PC as well.

When is the release date for Senua's Saga: Hellblade II?
There's no release date right now, or even a release window. At the Game Awards 2019, Phil Spencer noted that the title was early in development, so you shouldn't expect it as a launch title for Xbox Series X, or even shortly after launch. We'll be sure to provide updates on any official release date as soon as that information is available.
