Create main process for new data daily
	search for any files dated yesterday
	import them
	import ip_country table
	see what new ips are not matching (antijoin)
	add new ip/countries to file
	save to temp table
	append them to hits table
Create view that joins data
	Think about whether they need to update daily

updated comment text in initial_setup_hits_and_ip_country

Backup old data that wasn't backed (can rerun initial_setup_hits_and_ip_country.py)
	
check if enough room to back up website!
then back up!

Then start analytics
